I challenged myself to work on a different project every day untill I master JavaScript HTML and CSS. The ideas for all projects are taken from internet, but the all the code and the development is entirelly done
by me. All these projects are also meant to serve for educational purposes for beginners (please, keep in mind that I am not a certified tutor and my codes might not be the best knowledge source. I am still a junior developer). Feel free to take a look at them :)
